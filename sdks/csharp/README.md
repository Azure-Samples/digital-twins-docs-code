## Strategy

Most of the files in this folder are larger, self-contained snippets that combine several SDK calls to accomplish a specific purpose, according to a tutorial or how-to. Since these are individual samples, each one is kept separately as its own file. Documents can then reference these files by name to pull in the entire sample.

There are also files that contain partial snippets that illustrate a particular category of SDK call--models, twins, graphs, queries, eventRoutes, and authentication. These contain [named tags](https://review.docs.microsoft.com/help/contribute/code-in-docs?branch=master#named-snippet) that are used in the docs to reference a particular call or example from the file.
